Description :

You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

Solution:

if we are need to go to step 1 then only 1 way and to step 2 then in 2 ways so if we want to go to n th step then we need can go from n-1 or n-2 so if we want to go to n th step first we need to calulate number of ways to n-1 and n-2 then add those
