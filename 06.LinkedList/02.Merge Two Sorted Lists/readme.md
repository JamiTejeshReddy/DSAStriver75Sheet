Description :

You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists list1 and list2.

Merge the two lists into one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Return the head of the merged linked list.

Solution:

We are given two sorted Arrays so we use two pointers for two LLs and we create a new LL and store the smallest Node val in it and point the previous Node next to currentNode
